Instagram model Gia Duddy has broken her silence regarding her reported breakup with NFL quarterback Will Levis.

Levis and Duddy both went viral during the first round of the NFL Draft, where the quarterback was projected to be one of the first players selected. But he was forced to wait over four hours to not hear his name called - with the camera panning to him and his girlfriend on multiple occasions.
He would eventually be selected by the Tennessee Titans the following day, where he has become one of the backup quarterbacks to Ryan Tannehill this season.

But draft night saw both Levis and Duddy gain thousands of fans across social media, with many becoming invested in their relationship.

Recent reports suggest that the two had broken up last month - despite them still following each other on social media.

And on Monday, Duddy might have proved those rumours to be correct after sharing a TikTok insinuating that she suffered a tough month in September writing: "October plz be nice".

She then added: "Using this sound because last month was NOT it and I can’t risk repetition."A Barstool Sports podcast was the first to report that the two had split up last month, just a few weeks after Levis himself was on the show. Neither Levis nor Duddy have publicly confirmed or denied the split.

Levis had been the strong favourite to be selected with the fourth overall pick by the Indianapolis Colts, but the team instead opted to take Anthony Richardson.

His girlfriend, the 21-year-old Duddy, was by his side alongside family members as all 31 picks passed him by with cameras laser-focused on his reaction.

Levis started dating Gia when he was at Penn State before he transferred to Kentucky to become the starting quarterback for the Wildcats. It was there where he impressed enough to be considered a potential first-overall player.

Duddy was often present at Levis' games and had spoken about moving to Nashville to be with the quarterback.

Levis now looks to be the third-choice quarterback for the Titans, with Tannehill being the starter and former third-round pick Malik Willis being ahead of him in the pecking order.

The 24-year-old could have a tough road to being a starter with the Titans, and will likely not play a snap this season - hoping to instead impress once preseason comes around in 2024.Will Levis And Gia Duddy video took the internet by storm and amazed viewers on various social media platforms. Sophie Rain, a young and talented digital creator, recently became famous thanks to this interesting video.

Gia Duddy has dropped a subtle hint over her relationship status with NFL rookie QB  Will Levis amid rumors that she and the Titans signal-caller Titans are back together.

On Tuesday, the Penn State university graduate, who split from Levis in September - shared an observation that she realized, as of late: the sharp rise in separations, as she asked her fans on TikTok: 'What happened to cuffing season? Why is everybody breaking up right now?' 

'All of my friends have broken up with their boyfriends... what's happening? And it's not even like there's no dramatic breakups, everyone is just breaking up because it's not what's best for each other right now,' Duddy said. 


'Instead of summer being breakup season, it's fall and winter. I'm confused...'

A fan later commented: 'It's because Travis Kelce, Braxton Berrios and Chase Stokes are setting such a f***ing high bar that some men need to get too.'Duddy caught the eye of many NFL fans in April, when she joined Levis, 24, for Draft Night in Kansas City.

She watched the former Kentucky quarterback miss out on being selected as a first round pick before the Titans gave him a call to draft him as the 33rd overall pick.
